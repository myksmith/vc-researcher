# Neo: Investor Search Criteria Report

## Introduction
This document summarizes the investor search criteria for Neo’s $5M seed raise. 
It captures the parameters and target values that define the ideal investors to approach. 
The goal is to ensure a focused search targeting funds most aligned with Neo’s stage, sector, and enterprise-first strategy.  

## Search Parameters and Target Values

**Stage / Round focus:**  
Seed and early-stage funds (pre-seed/seed/Series A), plus multi-stage funds with active seed practices.  

**Cheque size range:**  
\$1M–\$5M, ideally with capacity to lead/co-lead a \$5M round. Target funds to lead that can write \$2M–\$3M lead checks.  
Do not exclude VCs with cheque sizes \$500k or more; just let me know that they are incapable of leading (and therefore I will prioritize later)

**Geo focus:**  
US, UK, and Western Europe (London, Berlin, Paris). Include global AI/infra-focused funds with enterprise track records.  

**Sector / Domain focus:**  
AI, enterprise SaaS, developer tools, SDLC automation, workflow automation, productivity, and infrastructure.  

**Theses / Themes:**  
AI-native theses, workflow-first automation, enterprise productivity transformation, future of work, AI for regulated/process-heavy industries.  

**Specializations:**  
Enterprise SaaS GTM (beyond PLG), selling into Global 2000 or regulated industries, AI/ML infra, and compliance/security-heavy sectors.  

**Portfolio composition:**  
Prior investments in AI devtools (Copilot competitors, Cursor, Windsurf, Codeium), enterprise workflow SaaS (Asana, Atlassian, Notion, Linear), 
AI infra (Hugging Face, Pinecone), and MSP/system integrator-related startups.  

**Follow-on capacity:**  
Funds with meaningful reserves for pro-rata and follow-on participation through Series A/B.  

**Value-add:**  
Investors who bring enterprise GTM playbooks, CIO/CTO connections, MSP/SI networks, and technical AI expertise.  

**Check frequency / lead vs. follow:**  
Preference for funds that frequently lead \$3M–\$5M seed rounds, not only followers.  

**Capital availability:**  
Funds that raised within the last 3 years, with \$100M+ fund size, and demonstrable dry powder (actively deploying).  

## Conclusion
These criteria define the “ideal investor profile” for Neo’s seed round. 
They will guide search and filtering on platforms like Crunchbase, PitchBook, and Signal, and provide alignment when qualifying introductions.
